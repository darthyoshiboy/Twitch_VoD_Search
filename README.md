This is a Python script to search a Twitch Streamer's VoD library chat history for any search term or user you desire.

The only values that need to be set are the `channel`, `twitchapiclientid`, and `searchterm` values near the top of the file.
Once you've set the `twitchapiclientid` to your Twitch API key value, `searchterm` to the User or term you want to search for, and `channel` to the channel whose VoD Chats you want to search, just run the script via your Python (2.7) interpreter: `python main.py`
